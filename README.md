Every day from the frist december till christmas eve Scrimba will provide the community with a coding challange which i am going to solve.

For every Challange i will push a new branch. So every day a new branch appear.

To get started, you can have a look at each png-file in folder. There you can read about the challange.
To see the solution head to "main.js" and to confirm it you can easily open the html file.
